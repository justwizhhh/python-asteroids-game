# Python Asteroids Game (ARCHIVE)

A clone of the arcade game 'Asteroids', featuring rotation-based player movement, respawning asteroids that can be broken into pieces, enemy objects, a score system, and more.

Made in ~2 months for a university assignment submission, as part of the "Games Tech 101' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology).
